Code for the 2023+ Beaver AUV team for the RoboSub competition. This repository includes code for the Arduino and Raspberry PI. If you're a future BVR team, all of this code is well documented, so it should be usable. <br />
(Also, we didn't use ROS, sorry. Look in the Arduino code for documentation on the system.)
