# This code is to fix the issue that a lot of our motors have a minimum speed, stopping us
# from correcting at small turns and leading to constant overshooting. It does this by having
# two diagonally opposite motors turning at one speed (this is just normal turning),
# but if it would go below the minimum instead it stays at that value and the other diagonal
# spins at the difference of the wanted and the minimum; eg. if you want to spin at 20 and 
# the minimum is 10, then two can just spin at 20 normally, but if you want to spin at 5
# then two can spin at 15 and the other two at 10 in the other direction, and 15 - 10 = 5

# this can be thought of generally as the first diagonal goes at the min + the speed you want,
# and the other diagonal goes at the min in the other direction; so min + speed - min = speed
